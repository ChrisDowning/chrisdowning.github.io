      <description>Minio is a simple, S3 compatible object storage server which can be deployed in a Docker container or as a simple binary and provides built-in deduplication over objects.
The application design is very much aligned with the microservices model - configuration is fairly minimal, and in the simplest case Minio can be launched using just a filesystem path in which the objects are to be stored. Each instance of Minio effectively operates in &amp;ldquo;single-user&amp;rdquo; mode, with one access key/secret key pair - in order to offer Minio to multiple users from the same server or cluster, the administrator need only deploy more Minio instances targeting a different directory per user (or &amp;ldquo;tenant&amp;rdquo;).</description>

      <description>This is a place for me to put written content which doesn&amp;rsquo;t have another home. Mostly, it&amp;rsquo;ll be technically-focused, perhaps with some commentary on blogs, articles and white papers I&amp;rsquo;ve written elsewhere.</description>
