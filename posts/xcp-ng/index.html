    <h1 class="title">XCP-ng</h1>
    
    <div class="content">
      <p>Earlier this year, the <a href="https://xcp-ng.org/" target="_blank">XCP-ng</a> project completed a round of crowd-funding to produce a fully open version of XenServer without any paid feature lock-down.</p>

<p>This is a project I was pretty excited about; although I had never tried XenServer or any VMWare tools common to enterpriste IT, I was keen to have a more flexible &ldquo;home lab&rdquo; setup than the bunch of RPi&rsquo;s and regular servers I&rsquo;d accumulated. <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/en/" target="_blank">ProxMox</a> was my first attempt at running a virtualised setup at home, but I hadn&rsquo;t enjoyed the experience much - I wanted something which would require less tinkering, ideally with a more modern interface.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, XCP-ng didn&rsquo;t live up to the hype for my use-case. The main issue wasn&rsquo;t actually the virtualisation software itself, which seemed to work without issue. Instead, it was the dashboard and GUI tool <a href="https://xen-orchestra.com/#!/xo-home" target="_blank">Xen Orchestra</a> that was the problem.</p>

<p>XO was developed by the team who kicked off the XCP-ng crowdfunding, and was originally developed for the original XenServer before being adapted to the open source alternative. While it might be a good tool (I don&rsquo;t have enough points of comparison to judge fairly), the feature lock-down for the free version was very distracting - I felt like I was using a small fraction of a real product. I was left with the impression that the whole crowd-funding thing was just a cunning wheeze to get more sales for their third-party management software, which seems rather hypocritical given that the main motivation for the split from XenServer was ostensibly to provide an alternative to an overly restrictive freemium model.</p>

<p>It only took a few hours for me to conclude that XCP-ng wasn&rsquo;t the right approach for me for the time being. At the moment, a simple CentOS + Vagrant/KVM server is likely to be my preferred solution for getting a few VMs running. Revisiting XCP-ng or ProxMox just to get a nice dashboard on a local server is seeming less and less likely as my public cloud usage increases - but I&rsquo;ll keep an eye on both projects to figure out if they are worth the hassle at a later stage.</p>
